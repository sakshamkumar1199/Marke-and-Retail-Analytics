# Marke-and-Retail-Analytics
OList is an e-commerce company. They have a wide variety of products. But for some time now they are facing heavy losses.  So they want to reduce unnecessary costs. For example, some products sell very high while some have very little. And the low sales lead to higher warehouse costs for these products. We have to identify which products sell more. Also, we have to understand the buying behavior of the customer using market basket analysis and analyze which product category is more likely to buy along with other products.  In this Capstone, we have to consider only delivered orders.
